                    <p>President Russell M. Nelson said: “Now the gathering takes place in each nation. The Lord has decreed the establishment of Zion in each realm where He has given His Saints their birth and nationality”</p>
                    <p>How does gathering in this way help us “be prepared in all things” for the Savior’s Second Coming?</p>

                    <h4>“Lift Up Your Voices … to Declare My Gospel”</h4>
                    <p>Elder Gary E. Stevenson taught that proclaiming the gospel “can be accomplished through simple, 
                        easily understandable principles taught to each of us from childhood: love, share, and invite”</p>
                    <p>Consider studying his message while thinking about your acquaintances, friends, and family. 
                        What ideas come to you about how you can share with them “what [you] love about the gospel of Jesus Christ”?</p>

                    <h2> April 14 - 20</h2>
                    <h4>"I Am He Who Liveth, I Am He Who Was Slain"</h4>
                    <p>What does it mean to say that Jesus Christ is “he who liveth”? It doesn’t just mean that He rose from the tomb and appeared to His disciples in Galilee. 
                        It means that He lives today. He speaks through prophets today. He leads His Church today. 
                        He heals wounded souls and broken hearts today. So we can echo the words of Joseph Smith’s powerful testimony: 
                        “After the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony … which we give of him: That he lives!”</p>
